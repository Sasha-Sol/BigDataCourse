I Can't Remember Anything
Can't Tell If this Is True or Dream
Deep down Inside I Feel to Scream
This Terrible Silence Stops Me
Now That the War Is Through with Me
I'm Waking up I Can Not See
That There Is Not Much Left of Me
Nothing Is Real but Pain Now

Hold My Breath as I Wish for Death
Oh Please God, wake Me

Back in the Womb it's Much Too Real
In Pumps Life That I must Feel
But Can't Look Forward to Reveal
Look to the Time When I'll Live
Fed Through the Tube That Sticks in Me
Just like a Wartime Novelty
Tied to Machines That Make Me Be
Cut this shit off from Me

Hold My Breath as I Wish for Death
Oh Please God, wake Me

(Please God, wake Me)

Now the World Is Gone I'm Just One
Oh God, help Me Hold My Breath as I Wish for Death
Oh Please God Help Me

Darkness

Imprisoning Me
All That I See
Absolute Horror
I Cannot Live
I Cannot Die
Trapped in Myself
Body My Holding Cell

Landmine

Has Taken My Sight
Taken My Speech
Taken My Hearing
Taken My Arms
Taken My Legs
Taken My Soul
Left Me with Life in Hell

No! No!
No! No! No! No!

Oh Please God Help Me
